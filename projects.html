				<h2>Projects</h2>

				<div class="project-card">
					<h3>WISTL Compiler</h3>
					<p>Developed a teaching compiler for the WISTL language in C,
						implementing a full pipeline including lexical analysis,
						recursive-descent parsing, semantic checks,
						and code generation targeting the JVM.
						Applied deterministic finite automata for scanning, recursive parsing for an LL(1) grammar,
						and symbol/type tables for semantic validation.
						In accordance with Stellenbosch University's Academic Integrity Policy this project can not be publicly hosted (Available on Request).
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="project-card">
					<h3>Homelab</h3>
					<p>
						• Deployed and managed a self-hosted homelab using a Raspberry Pi 5.
						• Deployed Pi-hole and Audiobookshelf in Docker containers, with Plex running natively.
						• Configured secure remote access through Tailscale VPN.
						• Gained hands-on experience with Linux system administration, networking, and container management.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="project-card">
					<h3>Personal Website</h3>
					<p>
						• Built a responsive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
						• Implemented a dynamic navigation system that allows switching between different pages without reloading the page.
						• Designed and styled the website to be visually appealing and accessible across different devices.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="project-card">
					<h3>Quasi-Palindromic DNA Analysis Utility</h3>
					<p>
						Built a Java program to search for and generate quasi-palindromic substrings in DNA sequences under user-defined constraints
						(substring length, swap limits, jump ranges). Implemented efficient algorithms for palindrome checking,
						minimum-swap detection, and recursive sequence generation with caching,
						enabling scalable analysis of large DNA inputs.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="project-card">
					<h3>Python-Based Board Game</h3>
					<p>
					Developed a two-player command-line board game in Python, implementing core game logic including piece movement,
					win conditions, and turn management.
					Engineered a robust system for move validation to ensure players adhered to game rules 
					and managed the game state and scoring, with points awarded for moving pieces into designated "sinks" on the board.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="project-card">
					<h3>Statera</h3>
					<p>
					Developed a comprehensive desktop application in Java using the NetBeans IDE 
					to help users balance their professional and personal lives.
					Engineered a 'Focus Mode' to block distracting websites 
					and an automated 'workaholic filter' that prompts users to take breaks after 60 minutes of work.
					Designed and implemented a multi-table Microsoft Access database to manage secure user accounts,
					track a gamified point system , and maintain user-specific lists of blocked websites.
